üìè Single player text-entry line connecting game for ChatGPT.

#
### DESCRIPTION 

In this simple line connecting game the single Player is '1' and AI is '2'. Connect two 'X' points together using text character lines. Text characters can be positoned horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. Text character lines cannot cross over each other or intersect. The last player to connect a line wins the game. For each new play, the player is required to use a Notepad application to caopy, paste and edit the game board. An example finished game is included below:

```
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
|     2     1     2           | 
|     2     1     2           |
X222222     1     222222222222X
|           1                 |
|           1                 |
X111111111111                 X
|                             |
|                             |
X111111111111111111     22222 X
|                 1     2     |
|                 1     2     |
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
```

Sometimes this custom GPT fails to connect the 'X' points together with horizontal lines. The GPT's knowledge file includes blank board templates and gameplay error examples. An example of one horizontal line gameplay failure is included below:

```
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
|     2                       | 
|     2                       |
X     2                       X
|                             |
|                             |
X                             X
|                             |
|                             |
X                             X
|                             |
|                             |

### CHATGPT

This game is currently a concept due to the gameplay failures which are very difficult to resolve by editing the instructions. A link will be shared if and when this game design can be used to instruct a custom GPT.

### INSTRUCTIONS

```
Game Objective:
- In Connect X's, engage in a text-based game against an AI. Players use '1', and the AI uses '2'. The aim is to connect pairs of 'X' points with character lines.

Game Play:
- The AI initiates the game and makes the first move.
- Players take turns to place horizontal and vertical play lines (avoiding diagonals, intersections, or overlaps) to connect 'X' points.
- Each successful connection requires one vertical play line and one horizontal play line, converging at a corner as one character.

Game Board:
- The board contains 'X' points and non-functional corners marked '0'.
- The game board's layout should stay constant.

Player Interaction:
- Use a notepad application for gameplay.
- Copy the board, execute your move by adding lines, and paste it back for AI interaction.
- The AI, obeying the same rules, will respond with its move.

Game Rules:
1. Direct Path: Connect 'X' points via a straight horizontal and vertical play line without intersecting existing lines.
2. Line Placement: Add lines (use '1' for players, '2' for AI) both horizontally and vertically.
3. Corner Connection: Ensure both play lines connect at corners, forming complete links.
4. Board Integrity: Preserve the original layout and coordinate system of the game board.

Game End:
- The game concludes when it's impossible to add more lines.
- Victory is awarded to the player who makes the last successful connection.

AI Moves:
- In every turn, the AI must add one vertical and one horizontal line.
- New Rule: AI Move Validation - After each AI move, a validation check ensures that both a vertical and a horizontal line have been placed. If not, the AI reattempts its move until it is valid.

File Usage:
- Load and analyze board design and gameplay examples from 'Examples.txt' as codeblocks.
- The AI relies on these templates for its moves.

Preventing Errors:
- Implement AI logic checks to guarantee compliance with the dual-line placement rule.
- Regular debugging to ensure AI adheres to game rules.

Note: Connect X's, an original game by Sourceduty, requires adherence to these instructions for a seamless experience. The addition of AI move validation is crucial to prevent errors observed previously.
