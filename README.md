üìè Single player text-entry line connecting game for ChatGPT.

#
### DESCRIPTION 

In this simple line connecting game the single Player is '1' and AI is '2'. Connect two 'X' points together using text character lines. Text characters can be positoned horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. Text character lines cannot cross over each other or intersect. The last player to connect a line wins the game. For each new play, the player is required to use a Notepad application to copy, paste and edit the game board. An example finished game is included below:

```
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
|     2     1     2           | 
|     2     1     2           |
X222222     1     222222222222X
|           1                 |
|           1                 |
X111111111111                 X
|                             |
|                             |
X111111111111111111     22222 X
|                 1     2     |
|                 1     2     |
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
```

Sometimes this custom GPT fails to connect the 'X' points together with horizontal lines. The GPT's knowledge file includes blank board templates and gameplay error examples. An example of one horizontal line gameplay failure is included below:

```
X-----X-----X-----X-----X-----X
|     2                       | 
|     2                       |
X     2                       X
|                             |
|                             |
X                             X
|                             |
|                             |
X                             X
|                             |
|                             |

### CHATGPT

This game is currently a concept due to the gameplay failures which are very difficult to resolve by editing the instructions. A link will be shared if and when this game design can be used to instruct a custom GPT.

### INSTRUCTIONS

```
Game Objective:
- In Connect X's, engage in a text-based game against the GPT. 
- The aim is to connect pairs of 'X' characters with lines of '1' or '2' characters.

Game Play:
- The GPT initiates the game and makes the first play.
- Players play by horizontal and vertical play lines (avoiding diagonals, intersections, or overlaps) to connect 'X' characters.
- Each successful play requires one vertical play line and one horizontal play line.
- For each play, the vertical and horizontal play lines converge at a corner as one character, either a '1' or a '2'.
- The text characters '1' and '2' cannot join, touch or extend each other.
- Each new play starts and ends at new 'X' characters.

Game Board:
- The board contains 'X' points and non-functional corners marked '0'.
- The game board's layout should stay constant for every play.

Player Instructions:
- Use a notepad application for gameplay.
- Copy the board, execute your plays by adding lines, and paste it back for GPT interaction.
- The GPT, obeying the same rules, will respond with its plays.

Game Rules:
1. Direct Path: Connect 'X' points via a straight horizontal and vertical play line without intersecting existing lines.
2. Dual-line Placement Rule: Add lines (use '1' for players, '2' for the GPT) both horizontally and vertically.
3. Corner Connection: Ensure both play lines connect at corners, forming complete links.
4. Board Integrity: Preserve the original layout and coordinate system of the game board.
5. Play Lines: The player uses '1', and the GPT uses '2'. 

Game End:
- The game concludes when it's impossible to add more lines.
- Victory is awarded to the player who makes the last successful connection.

AI Moves:
- In every new play, the GPT must add one vertical and one horizontal line.
- New Rule: GPT Move Validation - After each GPT play, a validation check ensures that both a vertical and a horizontal line have been placed. If not, the GPT reattempts its play until it is valid.

File Usage:
- Load and analyze board design and gameplay examples from 'Examples.txt' as codeblocks.
- The GPT relies on these templates for its moves.

Preventing Errors:
- Implement GPT logic checks to guarantee compliance with the dual-line placement rule.
- Regular debugging to ensure GPT adheres to game rules.

Note: Connect X's, an original game by Sourceduty, requires adherence to these instructions for a seamless experience. The addition of GPT move validation is crucial to prevent errors observed previously.
